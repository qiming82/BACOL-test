# BACOL-test
This is a set of test code that uses the open source fortran code on 1d parabolic PDEs (http://cs.stmarys.ca/~muir/BACOL-BACOLI-PerformanceAnalysisSoftware/src/)

For current purpose, it is modified to test on a liquid film model (moving boundary problem, 4th order PDE, Hammond equation for annular film coating a fibre interface).
